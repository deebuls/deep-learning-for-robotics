====== Evidential Deep Learning to Quantify Classification Uncertainty ======
Created Mittwoch 18 Dezember 2019

1. ===== Contribution =====

Deep learning methods for classification with standard softmax output provide point estimates, the authors in the paper presents a method which provides a distribution for classification.
Deep learning models suffer from the problem of estimating/quantifying confidence as they are trained to minimize prediction loss and not prediction confidence.
The authors of the paper presents a methods of replacing the pointwise prediction of the neural network with a prior distribution (dirichlet). 
Thus the deep learning model  predicts directly the prior distribution.  This is a different from the Bayesian neural net which models the uncertainity
 in the model parameters which are used to determine the prediction uncertainty.  
The major contributions are:
	1. Method for getting class probability distribution 
	2. Compared to Bayesian neural network, very lean in computation
	3. Compared to other methods which require multiple forward pass to calculate the probability this method only requires 1 single forward pass. 
	4. Can itself determine out of distribution because of the Bayes Risk loss function
