Created Mittwoch 18 Dezember 2019

===== 1. Contributions: =====
Please list three things this paper contributes (e.g., theoretical, methodological, algorithmic, empirical contributions; bridging fields; or providing an important critical analysis). For each contribution, briefly state the level of significance (i.e., how much impact will this work have on researchers and practitioners in the future?). If you cannot think of three things, please explain why. Not all good papers will have three contributions.

There are many examples of contributions that warrant publication at NeurIPS.  These contributions may be theoretical, methodological, algorithmic, empirical, connecting ideas in disparate fields (“bridge papers”), or providing a critical analysis (e.g., principled justifications of why the community is going after the wrong outcome or using the wrong types of approaches.).  One measure of the significance of a contribution is (your belief about) the level to which researchers or practitioners will build off of or use the proposed ideas. Solid, technical papers that explore new territory or point out new directions for research are preferable to papers that advance the state of the art, but only incrementally.  

This year, we are asking reviewers to try to list three contributions and their corresponding level of significance.  Not all good papers will have three contributions. For example, a ground-breaking theoretical paper might simply contribute the key theorem and proof (Significance: High).  However, for such a paper, hopefully you could also list “Presented a unified and extended view of several existing results. Significance: Medium.” or “Provided new proof path. Significance: High.”  

Please remain polite in this section and avoid writing “This paper did not contribute any new ideas.”  Instead write something along the lines of “Authors proposed model that primarily combines models in [cite A] and [cite B].  Significance: Low.”

For more examples of what is intended for this question, see section Examples of Review Content of this guide.

===== 2.  Detailed comments: =====
Please provide a thorough review of the submission, including its originality, quality, clarity, and significance.

Your comments should begin by summarizing the main ideas of the submission and relating these ideas to previous work at NeurIPS and in other archival conferences and journals. Although this part of the review may not provide much new information to authors, it is invaluable to ACs, SACs, and program chairs, and it can help the authors determine whether there are misunderstandings that need to be addressed in their author response. You should then summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the submission, focusing on each of the following four criteria: originality, quality, clarity, and significance. Clarification of these terms, as well as example quotes from past NeurIPS reviews, can be found in the section Examples of Review Content of this guide.

Your comments should be detailed, specific, and polite. Please avoid vague, subjective complaints. Think about the times when you received an unfair, unjustified, short, or dismissive review. Try not be that reviewer! Always be constructive and help the authors understand your viewpoint, without being dismissive or using inappropriate language. Remember that you are not reviewing your level of interest in the submission, but its scientific contribution to the field!

==== Quality: ====
Is the submission technically sound? Are claims well supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results? Is this a complete piece of work or work in progress? Are the authors careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work?

==== Originality: ====
Are the tasks or methods new? Is the work a novel combination of well-known techniques? Is it clear how this work differs from previous contributions? Is related work adequately cited?

==== Significance: ====
Are the results important? Are others (researchers or practitioners) likely to use the ideas or build on them? Does the submission address a difficult task in a better way than previous work? Does it advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way? Does it provide unique data, unique conclusions about existing data, or a unique theoretical or experimental approach?

==== Clarity: ====
Is the submission clearly written? Is it well organized? (If not, please make constructive suggestions for improving its clarity.) Does it adequately inform the reader? (Note: a superbly written paper provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce its results.)
