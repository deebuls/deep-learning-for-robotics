Sünderhauf, Niko, Oliver Brock, Walter Scheirer, Raia Hadsell, Dieter Fox, Jürgen Leitner, Ben Upcroft, et al. “The Limits and Potentials of Deep Learning for Robotics.” ArXiv:1804.06557 [Cs], April 18, 2018. http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06557.


* Motivating overview of important research directions to overcome the current limitations, and help fulfill the promising potentials of deep learning in robotics
* Research Questions:
	* How much trust can we put in the predictions of a deep learning systems when miscalssifications can have catastrophic consequences?
	* How can we estimate the uncertainity in a deep network's predictions ?
	* How can we fuse these predictions with prior knowledge and other sensors in a probabilistic framework ?
	* How well does deep learning perform in realistic unconstrained open-set scenarios where objects of unknown class and appearances are regularly encountered?
	* For data-driven learning
		* How to generate enough high-quality training data?
		* Do we rely on data solely collected on robots in real world scenario or do we require data augmentation through simulation?
		* How to ensure policies transfer from simulation to reality or between different robots?
	* How can the structure, constraints and the physical laws that govern robotic tasks in the real world be leveraged and exploited by a deep learning system?
* Challenges for Deep Learning in Robotics vision
	* Difference between Computer vision and robotic vision
	* Three different categories:
		* Reasoning challenges
			* Uncertainity estimation
			* Open set estimation
			* Incremental learning
			* Class-Incremental learning
			* Active learning
		* Embodiment challenges
		* Learning challenges
